# KSRTC(Kerala State Road Transport Corporation) Ridership Prediction

# About

Create a model to predict KSRTC Buses ridership of different routes.

# Objective: 
Create a model for predicting KSRTC buses ridership
# Steps and tasks:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Find a good predicting model for KSRTC buses ridership


# Contents
This is a KSRTC buses ridership data of different routes. This Data set contain 217388 rows and 41 columns.

* For predicting KSRTC ridership, I developed and compared various models.

For Creating a model i Used
1) Linear Regression
2) Random Forest Regression
3) Elastic Net
4) Bagging Regression
 
# Result:
Still continue on this project for getting good model

# Tools Used

1) Python
2) Pandas
3) Scikit-learn
4) Numpy
5) Jupyter Notebook
